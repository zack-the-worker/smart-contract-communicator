# Smart Contract Communicator

The Smart Contract Communicator is a powerful tool designed to simplify the interaction with ERC20 smart contracts. This tool is user-friendly and requires no setup. With it, you can easily call any method provided in a smart contract's ABI. Importantly, all data is saved on the client's machine, and no user data is stored elsewhere, ensuring your privacy and security.

## Features

- **Easy Interaction**: Just navigate to [Smart Contract Communicator](https://zack-the-worker.github.io/smart-contract-communicator/), input the chain RPC, the smart contract address, and the ABI, and you're good to go.
- **Supports All Methods**: This tool allows you to call all methods provided in the smart contract's ABI.
- **ERC20 Compatible**: Designed specifically for interacting with ERC20 smart contracts.
- **Privacy-Focused**: All data is saved on your own machine. We do not store any user data.
- **Send Raw Data**: You can send raw data directly to the smart contract, bypassing the selected method and parameters.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to the Tool**: Open your web browser and go to [https://zack-the-worker.github.io/smart-contract-communicator/](https://zack-the-worker.github.io/smart-contract-communicator/).
2. **Input the Chain RPC**: Enter the RPC of the blockchain network you want to interact with.
3. **Input the Smart Contract Address**: Enter the address of the smart contract you want to interact with.
4. **Input the Smart Contract's ABI**: Enter the ABI of the smart contract (in JSON format). The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a JSON array that describes the smart contract's methods.
5. **Input Your Private Key**: If you want to call a writable method (a method that updates data on the blockchain), you need to input your private key into the 'Private key' field. This is necessary to sign the transaction.
6. **Send with Raw Data**: If you input data into the 'Send with raw data' field, the tool will send the raw data directly to the smart contract, ignoring the selected method and parameters. This is useful for advanced users who want to manually construct the data sent to the smart contract.
7. **Interact with the Smart Contract**: Once the above details are entered, you can now call any method provided in the smart contract's ABI.

With the Smart Contract Communicator, interacting with ERC20 smart contracts has never been easier! Whether you're a blockchain developer or just a crypto enthusiast, this tool will make your life easier. Try it out today!
